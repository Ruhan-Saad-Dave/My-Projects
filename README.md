# My-Projects

## Introduction:

This is a repository created to store all the projects that I have done in one place. <br>
Mostly it will contain projects done by myself or in a small group. <br>
Projects made in a large team will be in a separate repository dedicated for that project, as all teammates contribute on the same folder.<br>
It doesn't contain other open source contribution projects, but you can check for it on my Github profile. <br>
